      "|                        Science Justification | In monitoring the GW localization of GW170817 we discovered this rapidly fading optical transient. The source is blue in color, and the rapid decay resembles that of AT2017gfo. No source is known at this location and it is not a minor planet. We request Swift XRT and UVOT coverage of this source to aid in classification. UV coverage is critical to understanding, and later modeling, this source as a kilonova. |\n",
